# Reflections for GPS 1.1

## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

This GPS session highlighted for me that I did not quite understand all the nuances between syncing up the remote repository branches and the local branches. There were a few times where my pair and I tried to do some additional pull requests and got tripped up because we did not properly sync our repositories or delete our feature branches once they were completed.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The good thing about making mistakes during the GPS is that we were able to learn from them! We figured out the correct order of operations to clean up our local repositories between completing a pull request and starting a new one. We learned how to resolve merge conflicts - both the given one in the example and ones of our own creation. We also learned that both relative and absolute paths are okay to use when linking to inline images in markdown (bonus!).

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Our guide was very good at giving us some basic guidelines for how to approach the pairing session, and then let us explore at our own pace. I had some questions for my pair about particular shortcuts and tricks in the command line, and felt like it was a good learning experience.

## What still confuses you about git?

I'm not that confused about the concepts, but as always, constant practice helps familiarize myself with the commands and with learning the correct workflow.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Navigating is a lot harder than driving! I kept getting ahead of myself in reading the instructions, and felt like that caused a couple of issues along the way. I had to keep reminding myself to slow down and follow the instructions step-by-step. I definitely felt more comfortable in the driver's seat but I look forward to practicing more navigation skills this week.
