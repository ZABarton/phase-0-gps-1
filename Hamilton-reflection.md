What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?


Pull requests workflow was not completely solidified in my mind. I feel much more trained now.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The pull requests and feature branches are a bit more clear now.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Not a whole lot. The guide gave us good intro instructions at the start of the session.

What still confuses you about git?

There is still a bit of confusion about why feature-requests appear as a drop-down on git-hub and sometimes it just appears as a pull request button.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was excellent, but we learned we need to go slower when following the instructions. When we got ahead of ourselves, we started stumbling.
